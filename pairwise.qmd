# Pairwise Sequence Alignment

> Most sequence database search programs depend to some extent on _pairwise sequence alignment_ - the process of identifying the mathematically optimal way to line up the symbols of two sequences _in order_ so that they are as similar as possible.

Consider the two words `COELACANTH` and `PELICAN`. These words are obviously different, but they are also similar enough that we can shift their letters about to make an alignment between them. For instance, we might align the words as:

```text
COELACANTH
-PELICAN--
```

so that the `E`, `L`, `C`, `A`, and `N` letters are in the same columns. The only differences are then the matching of the `O` of `COELACANTH` with the `P` of `PELICAN`, and the need to insert _gaps_ (`-` characters) to indicate where there is no corresponding letter, in the shorter word.

::: { .callout-caution collapse="true" }
## Is there another - or a better - way to align these words?

What if we were to align the words `COELACANTH` and `PELICAN` differently, like this?

```text
COELACANTH
P-ELICAN--
```

Is this a better or worse alignment of those two words than the one you originally saw? Why do you think this? What kind of rule would you devise to make a choice of which was the better alignment?

## Pairwise Alignment is a Solved Problem

Pairwise sequence alignment is a solved mathematical problem. What that means is that, if we are given:

- two sequences
- a scoring scheme for matching symbols, such as: 
  - a _match_ scores `+1` (e.g. `A` and `A` are in the same column)
  - a _mismatch_ scores `0` (e.g. `C` and `G` are in the same column)
  
we can **guarantee** to find the alignment with the largest possible score, using an _algorithm_ (i.e. a set of reproducible mathematical steps). The alignment with the largest score is considered the _optimal_ alignment. Such algorithms find one of two kinds of optimal alignment: either a _global_ or a _local_ optimal alignment.

## Is the optimal alignment biologically "real"?

Given that we can find an alignment with a maximum score - the _optimal_ alignment - why should we believe that this is the best _biological_ alignment?

If we change the scoring scheme we might change the alignment, so what features of a scoring scheme might make it a better or worse representation of biological "reality"?

On this page you will carry out two pairwise alignments, one _global_ and one _local_, of the same input sequences, to examine the differences between the two approaches. You will use the tools `Needle` and `Water` from the `EMBOSS` suite of sequence analysis tools (@Madeira2022-ii).

## Exercise 1: Global Pairwise Alignment

**Global sequence alignment** finds the optimal alignment acriss the full lengths of both sequences being aligned.

::: { .callout-note }
Given a scoring scheme, the [Needleman-Wunsch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm) is **guaranteed** to find an optimal global alignment between two sequences.

### Open the `EMBOSS Needle` webpage

Open the link [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/psa/emboss_needle](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/psa/emboss_needle) in a web browser, to reach the landing page (@fig-emboss-water)

![The `EMBOSS Needle` landing page.](assets/images/emboss-needle.png){#fig-emboss-needle  width="80%"}

### Enter the input sequences

Paste the two sequences given above into the two sequence input boxes, as shown in @fig-emboss-needle-seq.

### Set appropriate parameters

The two sequences you have entered are DNA sequences, so check the radio button marked `DNA` (@fig-emboss-needle-params)

![`EMBOSS Needle` input parameter set to `DNA`.](assets/images/emboss-needle-params.png){#fig-emboss-needle-params width="30%"}

### Run the alignment

Click on the `Submit` button at the bottom of the page to run the alignment. You can give your job a title, if you like (@fig-emboss-needle-title).

![`EMBOSS Needle` submit button.](assets/images/emboss-needle-submit.png){#fig-emboss-needle-title width="80%"}

A holding window will appear while the job runs (@fig-emboss-needle-running), and after a short wait you will be presented with the results page (@fig-emboss-needle-results).

![`EMBOSS Needle` results window.](assets/images/emboss-needle-results.png){#fig-emboss-needle-results width="80%"}

### Interpret the results

The key result returned by `Needle` is, of course, the overall sequence alignment, which is provided at the foot of the results page:

```text
sequence_1         1 ACTACTAGATTACTTACGGATCAGGTACTTTAGAGGCTTGCAACCA----     46
                                         ||    ||||||||||||||||||||    
sequence_2         1 --------------------TC----ACTTTAGAGGCTTGCAACCAGTAC     26

sequence_1        47 -----------------     46
                                      
sequence_2        27 TTTAGAGGCTTGCTCAC     43
```

::: { .callout-caution collapse="true" }
## What do you notice about the alignment?

- All bases from both sequences are represented in the alignment, even though the sequences are different lengths, and most bases are not found to align.
- Some bases in one sequence are aligned to the same base in the other - an _identity_ - as indicated by the pipe symbol (`|`)
- Some bases in the upper sequence are not aligned to any bases in the lower sequence, and _vice versa_. Where this happens, the other sequence is padded out with _gaps_ (`-`). In those regions, the runs of bases may be referred to as _insertions_, and the missing sections represented as gaps may be called _deletions_.
:::

## Exercise 2: Local Pairwise Alignment

**Local sequence alignment** finds the optimal (i.e. _highest scoring_) alignment between two _subregions_ of each input sequence.

::: { .callout-caution }
Local alignment **does not** attempt to align all bases between the two sequences. Instead, it compares segments of all possible lengths between the two sequences to optimise the similarity score that it calculates. Only the best-matching regions are aligned.
:::

::: { .callout-note }
Given a scoring scheme, the [Smith-Waterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm) is **guaranteed** to find an optimal local alignment between two sequences.
:::

::: { .callout-important title="Exercise 2 task"}
Using the same two DNA sequences as before, find their optimal local alignment using the `EMBOSS Water` program at [`EMBL-EBI`](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/psa/emboss_water).

### Interpret the results (MyPlace Questions)

The key result returned by `Water` is again the overall sequence alignment, which once more is provided at the foot of the results page:

```text
sequence_1        27 ACTTTAGAGGCTTGCAACCA     46
                     ||||||||||||||||||||

```

::: { .callout-caution collapse="true" }
## What do you notice about the alignment?

- Although the input sequences are the same ones that were used for global alignment, the local alignment is quite different: it is _much shorter_.
- Not all bases from either sequence are represented in the alignment - only bases `27` to `46` of `sequence_1` and bases `3` to `22` of `sequence_2`.
- Not all bases aligned in the global pairwise alignment are aligned in the local alignment.

## Which alignment - _global_ or _local_ - do you think does the best job of aligning these sequences? Justify your answer with one or two sentences.

Consider the kinds of biological questions you might ask. When do you need to have the context of the full sequence information? When do you only need to know the best matching region? Which percentage identity result best represents the extent to which the two sequences actually resemble each other?
:::


## Summary

::: { .callout-note title="Well done!"}
After completing this section you should:

- understand the difference between _global_ and _local_ pairwise alignments, and how to interpret their results
- know how to use the `EMBOSS` `Water` and `Needle` tools to obtain optimal pairwise alignments
- be able to explain the output from the `Water` and `Needle` tools

Now you are ready to move on to using `BLAST`, which uses _local_ sequence alignments to search large databases of reference sequences to find the best matches to an input query sequence.
