# Preface to {{< var ay >}} BM214 Workshop 2: Sequence Searching {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the BM214 (Being a Biomolecular Scientist 2) workshop on sequence searching in bioinformatics, for {{< var ay >}}.

This year is the first presentation of the workshop material in this format, and we would be very grateful to hear feedback [by email](mailto:{{< var admin.email >}}) or through the [GitHub repository Issues page]({{< var github.issues >}}).

## Overview

This workshop asks you to search for biological sequences _similar to_ a  [query sequence](glossary.qmd#query-sequence) in public sequence databases, using common bioinformatics tools.

::: { .callout-warning title="Important Note" }
There is new material in this workshop that is not covered in lectures, and this material is examinable. Please take care to reach the text in the expandable callout boxes, as well as that for the workshop activities, to be sure you have understood the topic and obtain full value from the exercise.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, students will be able to:

- Explain how the BLAST search algorithm works
- Use common bioinformatics tools, such as BLAST, to identify matches to a [query sequence](glossary.qmd#query-sequence)
- Interpret the output of common bioinformatics sequence search tools
- Compare, and make informed judgements between, the outputs from searches using different tools and databases

## Assessment

The workshop is not formally assessed although, as noted, all the material contained in the workshop is examinable. There is a formative assessment of short answer questions [on MyPlace](https://classes.myplace.strath.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=21632) which you should complete as part of the workshop.
