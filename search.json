    "text": "1.1 Why do we care about biological sequence similarity?\nIt may be surprising, but we do not know what all genes in an organism do. In some organisms, we may not even know what most genes do, or even whether we know all the genes that are present.\nIn general, the more similar two protein sequences are, the more likely they are to share the same functional activity, and to perform the same job for the organism they are found in. So, if we have a biological sequence of unknown function, and we can find a protein whose function we know whose sequence is similar enough to our sequence, then we can hypothesise that they have the same function.",

But even the genome of E. coli O157:H7 - maybe the best-understood genome we know - contains 756 coding sequences (CDS) annotated as hypothetical protein, which means we have no evidence of what its function is. This is 756/5067 ≈ 15% of the predicted proteome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctional Annotation Transfer\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigning a proposed function on the basis of sequence similarity to another sequence that has an annotated function is called functional annotation transfer. The vast majority of genes and gene products in public databases have functions assigned by this approach, and not by direct experiment. New sequences are added to these databases at a rate that far exceeds our ability to characterise their products experimentally.\nThe Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) is series of experiments and challenges designed to understand how well our computational methods of functional annotation match experimental reality (Zhou et al. (2019)).",

    "text": "1.2 Why does sequence similarity imply functional similarity?\nIf two proteins have the exact same sequence of amino acids, then they are essentially “the same thing.” We would expect them both to fold into the same structure, and to interact with the same molecules in the same ways. But the more changes we make to one of the sequences, the more likely it is that we will introduce a difference that results in a change to the structure or the functional activity of the molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not true that the number of sequence differences between two proteins is proportional to the difference in function.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the activity of an enzyme like chymotrypsin relies on the exact placement of three amino acid residues in a catalytic triad (Figure 1.1). If any one of these residues is substituted inappropriately, the enzyme no longer acts to catalyse the reaction that processes its substrate. However, several simultaneous substitutions can be tolerated elsewhere on the protein structure with no significant loss of catalytic function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The 1CBW structure of bovine chymptrypsin (transparent space-filling model), complexed with the inhibitor BPTI (rainbow-coloured cartoon). The catalytic triad Asp102-His57-Ser195 is shown in ball-and-stick representation. Changing any member of the catalytic triad for another residue would prevent chymotrypsin from working as an enzyme.",

The table in Figure 1.2 (Punta and Ofran (2008)) outlines some guidelines for interpreting functional similarity from sequence identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Table relating protein sequence identity to expected functional similarity at a number of levels, reproduced from (Punta and Ofran (2008)\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we can often consider proteins sharing at least 40% amino acid identity to also have a similar alpha carbon backbone structure. Proteins sharing less than 20% identity are likely to have dissimilar structures, and the range 20-40% identity is considered a twilight zone where it is difficult to predict whether two proteins have a common structure (Figure 1.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: A plot of pairwise protein structure dissimilarity (rmsd) against pairwise protein sequence identity for a set of membrane-spanning proteins, reproduced from Olivella et al.

Each has different contents, and may focus on one aspect of biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlways choose an appropriate sequence database for your biological question.\n\n\n\n1.4.1 INSDC\nAs a condition of publishing papers that describe new biological sequences - whether nucleotide or protein - those sequences must be deposited in a central public resource. For nucleotide sequence data, this is managed under the International Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), which is a collaboration between Japanese, US, and European organisations:\n\nDDBJ - the DNA Data Bank of Japan\nEMBL-EBI - the European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute\nNCBI - the National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA\n\n\n\n1.4.2 GenBank\nThe GenBank database contains the annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences, and is provided by NCBI as part of the INSDC. The initial release of GenBank in December 1982 contained 606 nucleotide sequences. As of December 2023, GenBank contains 249,060,436 nucleotide sequences, and 2,863,228,552 additional sequences deriving from whole-genome sequencing. The number of bases in GenBank doubles approximately every 18 months.\n\n\n1.4.3 RefSeq\nNCBI also provides the RefSeq (NCBI Reference Sequence Database), which provides a comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant, consistently annotated set of reference nucleotide, transcript, and protein sequences.\n\n\n1.4.4 UniProt\nUniProt is a resource for protein sequence and annotation data. It comprises three databases:\n\nUniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)\nUniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef)\nUniProt Archive (UniParc)\n\nThe main database of proteins is UniProtKB, and this is supported by UniRef - which clusters sequences on the basis of sequence identity - and UniParc, the archive of new, revised and obsolete sequences.\nUniProtKB is itself comprised of two databases:\n\nSwiss-Prot, a manually annotated and reviewed set of sequences where every annotation has been checked by a human\nTrEMBL, the remaining set of known sequences, whose annotations were dervied by automated assignment, and have not been reviewed by a human\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nManual annotation is time-consuming, and most proteins in UniProt have not been manually reviewed. As at 22nd February 2024:\n\nSwiss-Prot contains 570,830 manually-reviewed protein sequences\nTrEMBL contains 249,751,891 automatically annotated protein sequences\n\nThe current statistics can be found at UniProtKB\n\n\n\n\n1.4.5 InterPro\nInterpro is a service providing functional analysis of proteins by querying their sequences against a set of signature databases that contain patterns characteristic of particular functions or protein structures (Figure 1.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: The InterPro website allows simultaneous sequence-based search of several signature databases, to help annotate and classify protein sequences.",

BLAST provides four different programs to carry out these combinations of search.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: The four main BLAST programs, and the combination of query/database sequence type they are used for\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery type\nnucleotideDB\nproteinDB\n\n\n\n\nnucleotide\nblastn\nblastx\n\n\nprotein\ntblastn\nblastp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecialised BLAST tools\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NCBI BLAST webserver provides specialised search options with specific combinations of parameters and databases pre-selected to support particular kinds of search (Figure 3.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Specialised BLAST search options are available at the NCBI BLAST webserver\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Nucleotide BLAST from the NCBI landing page, to get to the blastn search page (Figure 3.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: The NCBI blastn webservice search page\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Enter the query sequence\nCopy the DNA sequence below, and paste it into the box marked  Enter accession number(s), gi(s), or FASTA sequence(s) at the NCBI search page (Figure 3.4).\nATGCGTCGAGGGCGTCTGCTGGAGATCGCCCTGGGATTTACCGTGCT\nTTTAGCGTCCTACACGAGCCATGGGGCGGACGCCAATTTGGAGGC\nTGGGAACGTGAAGGAAACCAGAGCCAGTCGGGCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: The NCBI blastn search page with a query sequence pasted into the query sequence field.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Set appropriate parameter choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf you make no more changes to the parameter settings for your search, the default options will be used. Your query will be made against the nr/nt complete nucleotide collection, a very large database. Due to the size of the database, the search may take a relatively long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving your searches by changing parameters\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can make your BLAST searches quicker, and more relevant to your biological question, if you can use information about your sequence and the type of organism you want to search.\nNCBI BLAST offers a number of smaller specialised databases with particular sequence types (e.g. RNA databases, sequences of protein structures, etc.) (Figure 3.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: A list of specialised sequence databases offered by the NCBI BLAST webserver\n\n\n\nYou can also narrow down the search by specifying an organism, or other taxonomic rank, using the Organism field (Figure 3.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Taxonomic options offered by the NCBI BLAST search organism field, for “Pseudomonas”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestrict the sequences being searched by typing “Homo sapiens” in the Organism field and selecting the appropriate option from the drop-down list (Figure 3.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Taxonomic options offered by the NCBI BLAST search organism field, for “Homo sapiens”\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Run the BLAST search\nClick on the BLAST button (Figure 3.8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: The NCBI BLAST webserver BLAST button.

For a pure isolate, this can be done using targeted PCR primers to amplify the gene from the organism’s genomic DNA (gDNA), and comparing the sequence obtained to a database of 16S gene sequences from known organisms.\n16S rRNA has a sequence that is well-conserved across all bacteria, due to its essential role as a scaffold in the small ribosomal subunit that is necessary for gene translation. The conserved regions of the gene allow the use of “universal” primers for PCR amplification, whatever the bacteria being studied. However, there are regions of variability where the sequence of nucleotides varies in a way that can be characteristic for a taxon.\nBy focusing on these variable regions, we can usually place a bacterium correctly at genus level.\n\n\n\n&gt;isolate_1_16S_rDNA\nACTCTAGTGGCGAACGGGTGAGTAACACGTGGGCGACCTACCCCCAAGTACGGCATAACCCCGGGAAACC\nGGAGCTAATTCCGTATGTGCTCGTACCTCCTATGGTACGCGTAAAGATTTATCGCTTGGGGATGGGCCCG\nCGGCGCATCAGCTAGTTGGTAGGGTAACGGCCTACCAAGGCGACGACGCGTAGCCGACCTGAGAGGGTGA\nCCGGCCACAGGGGCACTGAGACACGGGCCCCACTCCTGCGGGAGGCAGCAGTTAGGAATCTTCGGCAATG\nGGCGCAAGCCTGACCGAGCGACACTGCTTGGAGGATGAAGGTTTTCGGATCGTAAACTCCTGAACGAGGG\nACGAATAATGACGGTACCTCGCTAATAGCACCGGCTAACTCCGTGCCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACGGAGGG\nTGCAAGCGTTATCCGGAATCACTGGGCGTAAAGGGCGCGTAGGCGGTTTATTAAGTCCGATGTTAAAGCG\nTGAGGCTCAACCTCATCACGGCGTTGGATACTGGCAAGCTGGACGGTTGGAGAGGAAGGTAGAATTACCA\nGTGTAGCGGTGGAATGCGTAGATACTGGTAGGAATACCCATTGCGAAGGCAGCCTTCTGGACAACACGTG\nACGCTGAGGCGCGAAAGTGTGGGGAGCAAACCGGATTAGATACCCGGGTAGTCCACACCCTAAACGATGC\nATACTTGGTGTCGGCCCGTTGGGGTCGGTGCCGGAGTTAACGCGTTAAGTATGCCGCCTGGGAAGTACGG\nCCGCAAGGTTGAAACTCAAAGGAATTGACGGGGACCCGCACAAGCGGTGGAGCATGTGGTTTAATTCGAA\nGCAACGCGAAGAACCTTACCAGGTCTTGACATGCTAGGAACCTCTAAGAGATTAGAGGGTGCCCTTCGGG\nGAACCTAGACACAGGTGCTGCATGGCTGTCGTCAGCTCGTGTCGTGAGATGTTGGGTTAAGTCCCGCAAC\nGAGCGCAACCCTCGCTATTAGTTACCAGCACTTCGGGTGGGAACTCTAATAGGACTGCCTGTGAAAGCAG\nGAGGAAGGCGGGGGTGACGTCTAGTCAGCATGGTCCTTACGACCTGGGCTACACACGTGCTACAATGGCA\nGGTATAACGCGTCGCCAACTCGCGAGAGTGCGCTAATCGCTTAAAGCCTGTCCCAGTTCAGATTGTAGTC\nTGCAACTCGACTATATGAAGTTGGAATCGCTAGTAATCGCAGATCAGCATTGCTGCGGTGAATACGTTCC\nCGGGTCTTGTACACACCGCCCGTCAAACCATGGGAGTAGGTTGCACCCAAAGACGTAACGCTGCGTCAAT\nGCGGCTTGTGTTTAAGGTGTGGCTTATGACTGGGGTTAAGTCGTAACAAGGTAACTGTACCGGAAGGTGC\nGGTTGGATCACCTCCTTTCTAAGGAGTCAGTAAACAGGCTATTTCATCCCGGATTTTCATACCCCATATT\nTTGTGGGCGTTCGTCTA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour assignment\n\n\n\nTo identify this organism, you want to BLAST the 16S sequence against a suitable database of 16S genes at NCBI.

Some questions to consider:\n\nHow does the information in each pairwise alignment header relate to the table of results in the Descriptions tab? What extra information about the alignment can you find here, under this tab?\nScroll down the list of pairwise alignments.

Hint: try to find position 356 in the query sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints: Alignments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pairwise alignment headers give additional information, such as the numbers of identities and gaps, not just overall percentages. The alignments themselves are visible, which gives precise information about which bases differ between sequences.\nThere are regions where all the matched sequences seem to be similar, and regions where they all seem to vary.

The underlying algorithms were changed in some cases (e.g. for BLASTN), so results obtained using the two versions can differ, and in some cases the BLAST tools no longer use the BLAST algorithm.",
