    "text": "1.1 Why do we care about biological sequence similarity?\nIt may be surprising, but we do not know what all genes in an organism do. In some organisms, we may not even know what most genes do, or even whether we know all the genes that are present.\nAs biological sequences diverge through the actions of random mutation and nonrandom natural selection, they accumulate differences between them. The smaller the amount of time since two sequences diverged, the less time they have to accumulate these changes and, as a result, sequences from more closely-related organisms tend to be more similar to each other.\nIn general, the more similar two protein sequences are, the more likely they are to share the same functional activity, and to perform the same job for the organism they are found in. So, if we have a biological sequence of unknown function, and we can find a protein whose function we know whose sequence is similar enough to our sequence, then we can hypothesise that they have the same function.\nPart of the reason the sequence of a protein enables its function is that the sequence dictates how the protein folds into its final shape. This shape places catalytic centres, and recognition surfaces for other proteins and small molecules, into position so that the biochemical function can happen. Similar protein sequences fold up into similar shapes.",

    "text": "Warning\n\n\n\nModel organisms, such as Escherichia coli, are possibly the forms of life we understand best. But even the genome of E. coli O157:H7 - maybe the best-understood genome we know - contains ≈750 coding sequences (CDS) annotated as hypothetical protein, which means we have no evidence of what their functions are. This is 750/5067 ≈ 15% of the predicted proteome for that organism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctional Annotation Transfer\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigning a proposed function on the basis of sequence similarity to another sequence that has an annotated function is called functional annotation transfer. The vast majority of genes and gene products in public databases have functions assigned by this approach, not by direct experimental verification. New sequences are added to these databases at a rate that far exceeds our ability to characterise their products experimentally, so this situation is likely to persist for some time.\nThe Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) is series of experiments and challenges designed to understand how well our computational methods of functional annotation match experimental reality (Zhou et al. (2019)).",

    "text": "1.2 Why does sequence similarity imply functional similarity?\nIf two proteins have the exact same sequence of amino acids, then they are essentially “the same thing.” We would expect them both to fold into the same structure, and to interact with the same molecules in the same ways. But the more changes we make to one of the sequences, the more likely it is that we will introduce a difference that results in a change to the structure or the functional activity of the molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not true that the number of sequence differences between two proteins is proportional to the difference in function.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the activity of an enzyme like chymotrypsin relies on the exact placement of three amino acid residues in a catalytic triad (Figure 1.1). If any one of these residues is substituted inappropriately, the enzyme no longer acts to catalyse the reaction that processes its substrate. However, several simultaneous substitutions can be tolerated elsewhere on the protein structure with no significant loss of catalytic function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The 1CBW structure of bovine chymptrypsin (transparent space-filling model), complexed with the inhibitor BPTI (rainbow-coloured cartoon). The catalytic triad Asp102-His57-Ser195 is shown in ball-and-stick representation. Changing any member of the catalytic triad for another residue would prevent chymotrypsin from working as an enzyme.",

    "text": "1.3 How similar is similar enough?\nThere is no single value of “similar” short of 100% exact identity that is guaranteed to be “similar enough” to imply identical function. What might qualify as “similar enough” depends on the scientific question you are asking, and will vary if you are asking questions like:\n\nAre these two biological sequences from the same organism?\nDo these two biological sequences share a single common ancestor?\nDo these two enzymes share the same catalytic function?\nDo these two enzymes catalyse the same reactions for the same substrates?\nDo these two proteins fold into the same \\(\\alpha\\)-carbon backbone structure?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are some heuristics (rules of thumb) that can guide you in how confident you should be in, say, assigning functional annotation or common structure on the basis of sequence identity. The table in Figure 1.2 (from Punta and Ofran (2008)) outlines some guidelines for interpreting functional similarity from sequence identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Table relating protein sequence identity to expected functional similarity at a number of levels, reproduced from (Punta and Ofran (2008)\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we can often consider proteins sharing at least 40% amino acid identity to also have a similar \\(\\alpha\\)-carbon backbone structure. Proteins sharing less than 20% identity are likely to have quite dissimilar structures, and the range 20-40% identity is considered a twilight zone where it is difficult to predict whether two proteins have a common structure (Figure 1.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: A plot of pairwise protein structure dissimilarity (rmsd) against pairwise protein sequence identity for a set of membrane-spanning proteins, reproduced from Olivella et al.

Each has different contents, and may focus on a particular aspect of biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlways choose an appropriate sequence database suitable to answer your biological question.\n\n\n\n1.4.1 INSDC\nAs a condition of publishing papers that describe new biological sequences - whether nucleotide or protein - those sequences must be deposited in a central public resource. For nucleotide sequence data, this is managed under the International Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), which is a collaboration between Japanese, US, and European organisations:\n\nDDBJ - the DNA Data Bank of Japan\nEMBL-EBI - the European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute\nNCBI - the National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA\n\nThese organisations share their data, so have approximately the same core sequence records (although accession IDs vary between them).\n\n\n1.4.2 GenBank\nThe GenBank database contains an annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences, and is maintained by NCBI as part of the INSDC. The initial release of GenBank in December 1982 contained 606 nucleotide sequences. As of December 2023, GenBank contained 249,060,436 nucleotide sequences, and 2,863,228,552 additional sequences deriving from whole-genome sequencing. The number of bases in GenBank doubles approximately every 18 months.\n\n\n1.4.3 RefSeq\nNCBI also provides the RefSeq (NCBI Reference Sequence) database, which provides a comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant, consistently annotated set of reference nucleotide, transcript, and protein sequences.\n\n\n1.4.4 UniProt\nUniProt is a resource for protein sequence and annotation data. It comprises three databases:\n\nUniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)\nUniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef)\nUniProt Archive (UniParc)\n\nThe main database of proteins is UniProtKB, and this is supported by UniRef - which clusters sequences on the basis of sequence identity - and UniParc, the archive of new, revised and obsolete sequences.\nUniProtKB is itself comprised of two databases:\n\nSwiss-Prot, a manually annotated and reviewed set of sequences where every annotation has been checked by a human\nTrEMBL, the remaining set of known sequences, whose annotations were dervied by automated assignment, and have not been reviewed by a human\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nManual annotation is time-consuming, and most proteins in UniProt have not been manually reviewed. As at 22nd February 2024:\n\nSwiss-Prot contains 570,830 manually-reviewed protein sequences\nTrEMBL contains 249,751,891 automatically annotated protein sequences\n\nThe current statistics can be found at UniProtKB\n\n\n\n\n1.4.5 InterPro\nInterpro is a service providing functional analysis of proteins by querying their sequences against a set of signature databases that contain patterns characteristic of particular functions or protein structures (Figure 1.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: The InterPro website allows simultaneous sequence-based search of several signature databases, to help annotate and classify protein sequences.",

    "text": "Caution\n\n\n\nThere are implementations of BLAST or other sequence search methods at many other databases, and they may present a different interface and choice of options, or even a totally different search method. For example, the RCSB-PDB protein structure database offers a sequence search page which uses the mmseqs2 search algorithm (Steinegger and Söding (2017)).\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Navigate to the NCBI BLAST webserver\nOpen a web browser and navigate to the NCBI BLAST webserver. You should see a landing page that resembles Figure 3.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The landing page of the NCBI BLAST webserver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use an NCBI account to save searches\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that there is a Log in button at the top right of the landing page. If you have a suitable account with NCBI/NIH, NCBI maintains a record of your searches and history so you can store your searches and retrieve them later.\n\nSign up for a free NCBI account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Select the BLAST tool you want to use\nThe BLAST suite provides search tools for finding matches to a query in a database. The query can be either a nucleotide or a protein sequence, and the database being searched can contain either protein sequences or nucleotide sequences. BLAST provides four different programs to carry out these combinations of search.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: The four main BLAST programs, and the combination of query/database sequence type they are used for\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery type\nnucleotideDB\nproteinDB\n\n\n\n\nnucleotide\nblastn\nblastx\n\n\nprotein\ntblastn\nblastp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecialised BLAST tools\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NCBI BLAST webserver provides specialised search options with specific combinations of parameters and databases pre-selected to support particular kinds of search (Figure 3.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Specialised BLAST search options are available at the NCBI BLAST webserver\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Nucleotide BLAST from the NCBI landing page, to get to the blastn search page (Figure 3.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: The NCBI blastn webservice search page\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Enter the query sequence\nCopy the DNA sequence below, and paste it into the box marked  Enter accession number(s), gi(s), or FASTA sequence(s) at the NCBI search page (Figure 3.4).\nATGCGTCGAGGGCGTCTGCTGGAGATCGCCCTGGGATTTACCGTGCT\nTTTAGCGTCCTACACGAGCCATGGGGCGGACGCCAATTTGGAGGC\nTGGGAACGTGAAGGAAACCAGAGCCAGTCGGGCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: The NCBI blastn search page with a query sequence pasted into the query sequence field.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Set appropriate parameter choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf you make no more changes to the parameter settings for your search, the default options will be used.

For a pure isolate, this can be done using targeted PCR primers to amplify the gene from the organism’s genomic DNA (gDNA), and comparing the sequence obtained to a database of 16S gene sequences from known organisms.\n16S rRNA has a sequence that is well-conserved across all bacteria, due to its essential role as a scaffold in the small ribosomal subunit that is necessary for gene translation. The conserved regions of the gene allow the use of “universal” primers for PCR amplification, whatever the bacteria being studied. However, there are regions of variability where the sequence of nucleotides varies in a way that can be characteristic for a taxon.\nBy focusing on these variable regions, we can usually place a bacterium correctly at genus level.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;isolate_1_16S_rDNA\nACTCTAGTGGCGAACGGGTGAGTAACACGTGGGCGACCTACCCCCAAGTACGGCATAACCCCGGGAAACC\nGGAGCTAATTCCGTATGTGCTCGTACCTCCTATGGTACGCGTAAAGATTTATCGCTTGGGGATGGGCCCG\nCGGCGCATCAGCTAGTTGGTAGGGTAACGGCCTACCAAGGCGACGACGCGTAGCCGACCTGAGAGGGTGA\nCCGGCCACAGGGGCACTGAGACACGGGCCCCACTCCTGCGGGAGGCAGCAGTTAGGAATCTTCGGCAATG\nGGCGCAAGCCTGACCGAGCGACACTGCTTGGAGGATGAAGGTTTTCGGATCGTAAACTCCTGAACGAGGG\nACGAATAATGACGGTACCTCGCTAATAGCACCGGCTAACTCCGTGCCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACGGAGGG\nTGCAAGCGTTATCCGGAATCACTGGGCGTAAAGGGCGCGTAGGCGGTTTATTAAGTCCGATGTTAAAGCG\nTGAGGCTCAACCTCATCACGGCGTTGGATACTGGCAAGCTGGACGGTTGGAGAGGAAGGTAGAATTACCA\nGTGTAGCGGTGGAATGCGTAGATACTGGTAGGAATACCCATTGCGAAGGCAGCCTTCTGGACAACACGTG\nACGCTGAGGCGCGAAAGTGTGGGGAGCAAACCGGATTAGATACCCGGGTAGTCCACACCCTAAACGATGC\nATACTTGGTGTCGGCCCGTTGGGGTCGGTGCCGGAGTTAACGCGTTAAGTATGCCGCCTGGGAAGTACGG\nCCGCAAGGTTGAAACTCAAAGGAATTGACGGGGACCCGCACAAGCGGTGGAGCATGTGGTTTAATTCGAA\nGCAACGCGAAGAACCTTACCAGGTCTTGACATGCTAGGAACCTCTAAGAGATTAGAGGGTGCCCTTCGGG\nGAACCTAGACACAGGTGCTGCATGGCTGTCGTCAGCTCGTGTCGTGAGATGTTGGGTTAAGTCCCGCAAC\nGAGCGCAACCCTCGCTATTAGTTACCAGCACTTCGGGTGGGAACTCTAATAGGACTGCCTGTGAAAGCAG\nGAGGAAGGCGGGGGTGACGTCTAGTCAGCATGGTCCTTACGACCTGGGCTACACACGTGCTACAATGGCA\nGGTATAACGCGTCGCCAACTCGCGAGAGTGCGCTAATCGCTTAAAGCCTGTCCCAGTTCAGATTGTAGTC\nTGCAACTCGACTATATGAAGTTGGAATCGCTAGTAATCGCAGATCAGCATTGCTGCGGTGAATACGTTCC\nCGGGTCTTGTACACACCGCCCGTCAAACCATGGGAGTAGGTTGCACCCAAAGACGTAACGCTGCGTCAAT\nGCGGCTTGTGTTTAAGGTGTGGCTTATGACTGGGGTTAAGTCGTAACAAGGTAACTGTACCGGAAGGTGC\nGGTTGGATCACCTCCTTTCTAAGGAGTCAGTAAACAGGCTATTTCATCCCGGATTTTCATACCCCATATT\nTTGTGGGCGTTCGTCTA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour assignment\n\n\n\nTo identify this organism, you want to BLAST the 16S sequence against a suitable database of 16S genes at NCBI.

Some questions to consider:\n\nHow does the information in each pairwise alignment header relate to the table of results in the Descriptions tab? What extra information about the alignment can you find here, under this tab?\nScroll down the list of pairwise alignments. Do you notice any patterns in the alignments - specifically, do you see any regions where disagreement between the Query and Sbject sequences seems to be more common? Hint: try to find position 356 in the query sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints: Alignments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pairwise alignment headers give additional information, such as the numbers of identities and gaps, not just overall percentages. The alignments themselves are visible, which gives precise information about which bases differ between sequences.\nThere are regions where all the matched sequences seem to be similar, and regions where they all seem to vary. The region around position 356 in the query looks to be associated with an insertion in many of the matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the MSA viewer link in the report\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MSA viewer link will open a new tab containing a multiple sequence alignment of the matches to your sequence, showing differences in the matching sequences. Red marks indicate a base substitution, blue marks indicate an insertion relative to the query. You can use the zoom tool to zoom in and see individual base differences.\nSome questions to consider:\n\nAre the results in the tree consistent with the results in the Descriptions tab? Is there any extra information here that is not found in the Descriptions tab?\nDo the sequences from the best match to your query differ in the sequence alignment? Where do they differ?\nAre there clear patterns of sequence conservation (grey) and variation (red/blue)? Do these look similar to the patterns you saw in the pairwise sequence alignments?\nLook at position 356 in the query sequence. How do most of the matches differ from the query here? Do the best matches differ from the query at this position in the same way?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints: MSA viewer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, they are consistent. The alignment gives information about the location and nature of sequence differences between the query and each match.\nYes, the best match sequences differ, at a number of regions throughout the sequence length.\nYes, there are clear patterns of conservation and variation. It was difficult to spot these with the pairwise sequence alignments.\nMost matches that are not the best-match organism have an insertion here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Inspect the graphic summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Graphic Summary tab in the report\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Graphic Summary tab shows a visual representation of the pairwise sequence alignments for each match BLAST has found for your query sequence. Some questions to consider:\n\nDo all the subject sequences align to the same location on the query sequence?\nIf the subject sequences do not all align to the same locations, are there any regions of the query sequence to which they all consistently align?\nDid you see any gaps in the pairwise alignments when you examined the results under the Alignments tab? If you did, can you see them in the Graphic Summary?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints: Graphic Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nAll the matches appear to align to a core region spanning most of the centre of the query sequence.\nAny gaps don’t seem to be visible - the lines indicating matches are continuous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Inspect the match taxonomy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Taxonomy tab in the report\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Taxonomy tab summarises the taxonomic assignments for each match BLAST has found for your query sequence.

Some questions to consider:\n\nAre the results in the tree consistent with the results in the Descriptions tab? Is there any extra information here that is not found in the Descriptions tab?\nDo you think it is equally likely that your organism is related to the best match, as it is to the next most similar organism’s sequence that you found?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints: Distance tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, they are consistent. The tree gives us evolutionary information about the order of divergence of each organism’s sequences, when they diverged, and also which organisms’ sequences are more similar to each other.\nThe best match organism appears to be distinct from (diverged separately from) the next-best matching organism, so the query looks to be more related to the best match’s taxon than to that of the next-best match.",

Our understanding of these communities has been enhanced by metagenomic analyses that tell us which organisms are present in which communities, but also by metaproteomic analyses (e.g. Kolmeder et al. (2012)) which give insight into the molecular activities expressed by these communities.\nKnowing what the normal, stable, gut microbial community looks like allows us to identify dysbioses - disturbances to the normal operation of these biological systems. MALDI-ToF (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption - Time of Flight mass spectrometry) is a valuable tool for identifying which organisms are present (e.g. Feucherolles et al. (2019)) and also for identifying and quantifying disturbances due to disease and measured as changes in the presence, absence, and abundances of proteins produced by the microbial communities (Debyser et al. (2019)).\n\n\n\n\n&gt;seq1437_abd10275_rank7\nMVKIIFVFFIFLSSFSYANDDKLYRADSRPPDEIKQSGGLMPRGQSEYFDRGTQMNINLYDHARGTQTGF\nVRHDDGYVSTSISLRSAHLVGQTILSGHSTYYIYVIATAPNMFNVNDVLGAYSPHPDEQEVSALGGIPYS\nQIYGWYRVHFGVLDEQLHRNRGYRDRYYSNLDIAPAADGYGLAGFPPEHRAWREEPWIHHAPPGCGNAPR\nSSMSNTCDEKTQSLGVKFLDEYQSKVKRQIFSGYQSDIDTHNRIKDEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour assignment\n\n\n\nTo identify the potential function of this highly-abundant sequence, and the organism from which it comes, you want to BLAST the protein sequence against a suitable reference database at NCBI.

At the top of the Graphic Summary tab there is a clickable graphical indicator of a putative conserved domain in your protein. Click on the green box. This will open an entry in the NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD).\nClick on the small [+] symbol at the left of the entry to see an alignment of your protein against the canonical sequence for the conserved domain.\nConserved domains are usually associated with Protein Family (PFam) domain records. This is also true for the matches to your protein. Click on the link to the PFam entry (in the Accession column of the CDD record) to be taken to a multiple sequence alignment of representative sequences for this domain, which opens in a new tab.\nTo see the PFam record itself, click on the Source: pfam link in the Links box at the top of this page.
