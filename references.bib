  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation
               (CAFA) is an ongoing, global, community-driven effort to
               evaluate and improve the computational annotation of protein
               function. RESULTS: Here, we report on the results of the third
               CAFA challenge, CAFA3, that featured an expanded analysis over
               the previous CAFA rounds, both in terms of volume of data
               analyzed and the types of analysis performed. In a novel and
               major new development, computational predictions and assessment
               goals drove some of the experimental assays, resulting in new
               functional annotations for more than 1000 genes. Specifically,
               we performed experimental whole-genome mutation screening in
               Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aureginosa genomes, which
               provided us with genome-wide experimental data for genes
               associated with biofilm formation and motility. We further
               performed targeted assays on selected genes in Drosophila
               melanogaster, which we suspected of being involved in long-term
               memory. CONCLUSION: We conclude that while predictions of the
               molecular function and biological process annotations have
               slightly improved over time, those of the cellular component
               have not. Term-centric prediction of experimental annotations
               remains equally challenging; although the performance of the top
               methods is significantly better than the expectations set by
               baseline methods in C. albicans and D. melanogaster, it leaves
               considerable room and need for improvement. Finally, we report
               that the CAFA community now involves a broad range of
               participants with expertise in bioinformatics, biological
               experimentation, biocuration, and bio-ontologies, working
               together to improve functional annotation, computational
               function prediction, and our ability to manage big data in the
               era of large experimental screens.",

  author    = "Sander, C and Schneider, R",
  abstract  = "The database of known protein three-dimensional structures can
               be significantly increased by the use of sequence homology,
               based on the following observations. (1) The database of known
               sequences, currently at more than 12,000 proteins, is two orders
               of magnitude larger than the database of known structures. (2)
               The currently most powerful method of predicting protein
               structures is model building by homology. (3) Structural
               homology can be inferred from the level of sequence similarity.
               (4) The threshold of sequence similarity sufficient for
               structural homology depends strongly on the length of the
               alignment. Here, we first quantify the relation between sequence
               similarity, structure similarity, and alignment length by an
               exhaustive survey of alignments between proteins of known
               structure and report a homology threshold curve as a function of
               alignment length. We then produce a database of homology-derived
               secondary structure of proteins (HSSP) by aligning to each
               protein of known structure all sequences deemed homologous on
               the basis of the threshold curve. For each known protein
               structure, the derived database contains the aligned sequences,
               secondary structure, sequence variability, and sequence profile.
               Tertiary structures of the aligned sequences are implied, but
               not modeled explicitly. The database effectively increases the
               number of known protein structures by a factor of five to more
               than 1800. The results may be useful in assessing the structural
               significance of matches in sequence database searches, in
               deriving preferences and patterns for structure prediction, in
               elucidating the structural role of conserved residues, and in
               modeling three-dimensional detail by homology.",

               contain only two types of folds in their transmembrane domains:
               $\alpha$-helix bundles and $\beta$-barrels. The increasing
               number of available crystal structures of these proteins permits
               an initial estimation of how sequence variability affects the
               structure conservation in their transmembrane domains. We, thus,
               aim to determine the pairwise sequence identity necessary to
               maintain the transmembrane molecular architectures compatible
               with the hydrophobic nature of the lipid bilayer. Results:
               Root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) and sequence identity were
               calculated from the structural alignments of pairs of homologous
               polytopic membrane proteins sharing the same fold. Analysis of
               these data reveals that transmembrane segment pairs with
               sequence identity in the so-called `twilight zone' (20--35\%)
               display high-structural similarity (rmsd < 1.5 {\AA}). Moreover,
               a large group of $\beta$-barrel pairs with low-sequence identity
               (<20\%) still maintain a close structural similarity (rmsd < 2.5
               {\AA}). Thus, we conclude that fold preservation in
               transmembrane regions requires less sequence conservation than
               for globular proteins. These findings have direct implications
               in homology modeling of evolutionary-related membrane proteins.

               bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
               (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics,
               the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very
               long queries or database sequences. There are also some
               shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line
               applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of
               rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line
               applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for
               processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run
               times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve
               only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and
               memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of
               contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking
               information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A
               new modular software library can now access subject sequence
               data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new
               features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and
               reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be
               uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.
               CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to
               the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed
               improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length
